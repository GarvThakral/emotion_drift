# ðŸ§  Emotion Drift Monitor (EDM)

A real-time system to monitor emotional trends in social media comments (e.g., YouTube, Reddit), track shifts in public sentiment, and detect potential mental health signals over time.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Classify emotions from text using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.
- Analyze trends in emotional tone across time, topics, or users.
- Visualize changes in sentiment using dashboards.
- Detect and report possible emotion drift (e.g., joy â†’ sadness).
- Use MLOps best practices (ZenML, MLflow) to manage training and inference pipelines.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features (Planned)

- âœ… Fine-tuned emotion classifier (based on GoEmotions dataset).
- âœ… Input preprocessing using `transformers` tokenizer.
- ðŸ”² Real-world comment ingestion (YouTube/Reddit).
- ðŸ”² Emotion drift detection over time (with thresholds).
- ðŸ”² Visualization dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly).
- ðŸ”² ZenML pipeline for reproducibility.
- ðŸ”² MLflow for experiment tracking.
